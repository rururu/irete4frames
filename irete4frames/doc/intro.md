Introduction to Rete for Frames
----
This rete implementation uses a simple language for knowledge representation [The Language] (https://github.com/rururu/rete4frames/blob/master/doc/language.md).
This language is a simplification of the well known language [CLIPS] (http://clipsrules.sourceforge.net/).
Application program interface described in [API] (https://github.com/rururu/rete4frames/blob/master/doc/api.md).
Well known CLIPS examples and their implementations on this language are in [examples] (https://github.com/rururu/rete4frames/blob/master/examples).
Application program interface for embedding Rete for Frames into Java programs described in [Java Interface] (https://github.com/rururu/rete4frames/blob/master/doc/java_interface.md).
Example of using Java interface is in [Eclipse project] (https://github.com/rururu/rete4frames/blob/master/Rete4framesEclipseTest/src/test/ReteTest.java).
